faqs:
  - title: Is Kyo only for people diagnosed with ADHD?
    answer: While Kyo is designed with ADHD in mind, it can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their emotional regulation and self-awareness. The app's features are helpful for managing emotions regardless of a formal ADHD diagnosis. Whether you have ADHD, suspect you might, or simply want to better understand and manage your emotions, Kyo can be a valuable tool in your personal growth journey.

  - title: How does Kyo protect my privacy?
    answer: At Kyo, we take your privacy seriously. All your data is encrypted and stored securely using industry-standard protocols. Your personal information and emotional data are never shared or sold to third parties. We believe in giving you full control over your data - you can export or delete it at any time. Our [privacy policy](https://www.kyoapp.com/privacy) provides more detailed information about how we handle and protect your data.

  - title: Can Kyo replace therapy or medication for ADHD?
    answer: No, Kyo is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It's designed to be a supportive tool alongside your existing ADHD management strategies. While Kyo can help you track moods, identify patterns, and learn coping strategies, it should be used in conjunction with, not instead of, professional care. Always consult with your healthcare provider about your ADHD treatment plan and before making any changes to your medication or therapy regimen.

  - title: How often should I use Kyo to see benefits?
    answer: For best results, we recommend using Kyo daily for mood tracking and reflection. Consistent use allows the app to gather more data, providing you with more accurate insights and patterns over time. However, we understand that everyone's routine is different. Even using Kyo a few times a week can provide valuable insights into your emotional patterns. The app is designed to be flexible, allowing you to integrate it into your routine in a way that works best for you. Remember, the key is consistency - find a usage pattern that you can stick to long-term.

  - title: Are you a healthcare professional or ADHD specialist?
    answer: No, I am not a healthcare professional, ADHD specialist, or licensed therapist. Kyo is a tool I created based on extensive research and personal experience with ADHD, but it should not be considered medical advice. The app is designed to support, not replace, professional care. While we strive to provide accurate and helpful information, it's crucial to consult with qualified healthcare providers for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment related to ADHD or any other health concerns. Kyo is a supportive tool to complement professional care, not a substitute for it.

  - title: What devices is Kyo compatible with?
    answer: Kyo is designed to be widely accessible. It's available for both iOS and Android smartphones, ensuring compatibility with most modern mobile devices. The app is optimized for various screen sizes, from phones to tablets, providing a seamless experience across different devices. We're continuously working on improvements to enhance the user experience across all supported platforms.
